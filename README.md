## [Documentation](https://playwright.dev) | [API reference](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-playwright)

Playwright is a framework for web automation and testing. It drives Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with a single API: in your tests, in your scripts, and as a tool for AI agents.

## About This Fork

Tracks upstream `microsoft/playwright`. Local changes:

**Bun runtime.** Playwright runs under Bun as a first-class target alongside Node. Tests can use `Bun.*` APIs directly (`Bun.file`, `Bun.serve`, `Bun.spawn`, `Bun.$`, etc.). The worker IS a Bun process under Bun. Upstream `microsoft/playwright` does not run under Bun; the fork is the only working option there.

> **Benchmarks (Node v24 vs Bun 1.3, Apple Silicon).** Bun is 10–18% faster on compatible suites. Both runtimes pass the full 217-test fork suite reliably (3/3 runs, 0 failures). Use Bun when your specs need Bun APIs; otherwise Node 24 is the safer default.
>
> | Suite | Node | Bun | Speedup |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | Lightweight (4 tests) | 1.74s | 1.58s | Bun +10% |
> | Heavy (30+ tests) | 6.96s | 5.91s | Bun +18% |
> | Full fork (217 tests) | 8.3s | 7.6s | Bun +9% |

**Mobile package.** `@playwright/experimental-mobile` exposes a `mobileTest` fixture that drives Appium 2 over W3C WebDriver classic: iOS (XCUITest) and Android in one API. No `selenium-webdriver` or `webdriverio` at runtime. Full Playwright web API parity on `AppLocator` — `getByRole`, `getByText`, `getByLabel`, `getByTestId`, `getByPlaceholder`, `getByAltText`, `getByTitle`, `tap`, `check`, `uncheck`, `press`, `scrollIntoViewIfNeeded`, `dragTo`, `focus`, `blur`, `boundingBox`, and more. See [packages/playwright-mobile/README.md](packages/playwright-mobile/README.md).

**Storybook package.** `@playwright/experimental-storybook` auto-discovers stories and generates Playwright tests. Supports `composeStories` CT mode for testing components without a running Storybook server. See [packages/playwright-storybook/README.md](packages/playwright-storybook/README.md).

**Lighthouse package.** `@playwright/lighthouse` runs Lighthouse against the same Chromium tab the test is driving; `--remote-debugging-port` is wired by the fixture. See [packages/playwright-lighthouse/README.md](packages/playwright-lighthouse/README.md).

```ts
import { lighthouseTest as test, expect } from '@playwright/lighthouse';

test('homepage perf budget', async ({ page, lighthouse }) => {
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  const result = await lighthouse({
    thresholds: { performance: 90, accessibility: 95 },
    saveReport: 'html',
  });
  expect(result.passed, result.failures.join('\n')).toBe(true);
});
```

**Cloud client.** `playwright.appium.connectToCloud(wsEndpoint, capabilities, options)` connects to a remote device farm via WebSocket with token auth, configurable timeouts, and bidirectional lifecycle management.

**Locators.** `getById(id, { exact? })` and `getByClassName(name, { exact? })` on `Page`, `Locator`, `Frame`, and `FrameLocator`. Substring match by default; `{ exact: true }` for strict.

```ts
await page.getById('submit-btn').click();              // matches "submit-btn-9a8f"
await page.getById('submit-btn-9a8f', { exact: true }).click();
await expect(page.getByClassName('featured')).toHaveCount(1);
await expect(page.getByClassName('card', { exact: true })).toHaveCount(2);
```

**Reporters.** Added built-in shorthands: `catalog`, `ai`, `csv`, `jira`, `new-relic`, `xray`.

**Matchers.** Added `toBeWithinRange`, `toHaveResponseProperty`, `toMatchJsonSchema`.

**Upstream sync tooling.** `utils/sync_upstream.sh` (dry-run merge analysis) and `utils/analyze_upstream.sh` (conflict prediction) for safe upstream pulls.

**Upstream PRs carried locally.** Patches not merged upstream, e.g. [shardingMode #30962](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/pull/30962) (`partition` / `round-robin` / `duration-round-robin`).

## Playwright Test

Playwright Test is a full-featured test runner built for end-to-end testing. It runs tests across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with full browser isolation, auto-waiting, and web-first assertions.

### Install

```bash
npm init playwright@latest
```

Or add manually:

```bash
npm i -D @playwright/test
npx playwright install
```

### Write a test

```TypeScript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('has title', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Playwright/);
});

test('get started link', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
  await page.getByRole('link', { name: 'Get started' }).click();
  await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Installation' })).toBeVisible();
});
```

### Run tests

```bash
npx playwright test
```

Tests run in parallel across all configured browsers, in headless mode by default. Each test gets a fresh browser context with full isolation and near-zero overhead.

### Key capabilities

**Auto-wait and web-first assertions.** No artificial timeouts. Playwright waits for elements to be actionable, and assertions automatically retry until conditions are met.

**Locators.** Find elements with resilient locators that mirror how users see the page:

```TypeScript
page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })
page.getByLabel('Email')
page.getByPlaceholder('Search...')
page.getByTestId('login-form')
```

**Test isolation.** Each test runs in its own browser context, equivalent to a fresh browser profile. Save authentication state once and reuse it across tests:

```TypeScript
// Save state after login
await page.context().storageState({ path: 'auth.json' });

// Reuse in other tests
test.use({ storageState: 'auth.json' });
```

**Tracing.** Capture execution traces, screenshots, and videos on failure. Inspect every action, DOM snapshot, network request, and console message in the [Trace Viewer](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer):

```TypeScript
// playwright.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  use: {
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
  },
});
```

```bash
npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
```

<!-- TODO: screenshot of trace viewer -->

**Parallelism.** Tests run in parallel by default across all configured browsers.

## Playwright CLI

[Playwright CLI](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli) is a command-line interface for browser automation designed for coding agents. It's more token-efficient than MCP; commands avoid loading large tool schemas and accessibility trees into the model context.

### Install

```bash
npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest
```

Optionally install skills for richer agent integration:

```bash
playwright-cli install --skills
```

### Usage

Point your coding agent at a task:

```
Test the "add todo" flow on https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc using playwright-cli.
Take screenshots for all successful and failing scenarios.
```

Or run commands directly:

```bash
playwright-cli open https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc/ --headed
playwright-cli type "Buy groceries"
playwright-cli press Enter
playwright-cli screenshot
```

### Session monitoring

Use `playwright-cli show` to open a visual dashboard with live screencast previews of all running browser sessions. Click any session to zoom in and take remote control.

```bash
playwright-cli show
```

<!-- TODO: screenshot of playwright-cli show dashboard -->

## Playwright MCP

The [Playwright MCP server](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) gives AI agents full browser control through the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). Agents interact with pages using structured accessibility snapshots, with no vision models or screenshots required.

### Setup

Add to your MCP client (VS Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop, Windsurf, etc.):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

**One-click install for VS Code:**

[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-VS_Code?style=flat-square&label=Install%20MCP%20Server&color=0098FF" alt="Install in VS Code" />](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode%3Amcp%2Finstall%3F%257B%2522name%2522%253A%2522playwright%2522%252C%2522command%2522%253A%2522npx%2522%252C%2522args%2522%253A%255B%2522%2540playwright%252Fmcp%2540latest%2522%255D%257D)

**For Claude Code:**

```bash
claude mcp add playwright npx @playwright/mcp@latest
```

### How it works

Ask your AI assistant to interact with any web page:

```
Navigate to https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc and add a few todo items.
```

The agent sees the page as a structured accessibility tree:

```
- heading "todos" [level=1]
- textbox "What needs to be done?" [ref=e5]
- listitem:
  - checkbox "Toggle Todo" [ref=e10]
  - text: "Buy groceries"
```

It uses element refs like `e5` and `e10` to click, type, and interact deterministically, without visual ambiguity. Tools cover navigation, form filling, screenshots, network mocking, storage management, and more.

## Playwright Library

Use `playwright` as a library for browser automation scripts: web scraping, PDF generation, screenshot capture, and any workflow that needs programmatic browser control without a test runner.

### Install

```bash
npm i playwright
```

### Examples

**Take a screenshot:**

```TypeScript
import { chromium } from 'playwright';

const browser = await chromium.launch();
const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshot.png' });
await browser.close();
```

**Generate a PDF:**

```TypeScript
import { chromium } from 'playwright';

const browser = await chromium.launch();
const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
await page.pdf({ path: 'page.pdf', format: 'A4' });
await browser.close();
```

**Emulate a mobile device:**

```TypeScript
import { chromium, devices } from 'playwright';

const browser = await chromium.launch();
const context = await browser.newContext(devices['iPhone 15']);
const page = await context.newPage();
await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
await page.screenshot({ path: 'mobile.png' });
await browser.close();
```

**Intercept network requests:**

```TypeScript
import { chromium } from 'playwright';

const browser = await chromium.launch();
const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.route('**/*.{png,jpg,jpeg}', route => route.abort());
await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
await browser.close();
```
